# Models-of-linguistic-convergence-in-a-hunter-gatherer-community

This repository contains scripts used in the paper *Linguistic stability and change under small-scale egalitarian language contact: a mixture model approach*. The script `run.sh` runs the relevant scripts. Best performance was achieved using conda installation of PyMC3 version 3.7 (https://docs.anaconda.com/).
